                <h2>Chinese Zodiac Animals</h2>
                <p>The Tiger ranks third among the animals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac"
                        target="_blank" id="zodiac">Chinese zodiac</a>. The
                    12 zodiac animals are, in order: <strong> <em>Rat, Ox,
                            Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig </em> </strong>.
                    Each year is related
                    to an
                    animal sign
                    according to a 12-year-cycle.</p>
                <h2>Year of the Tiger</h2>
                <p>2022 is a year of the Tiger. Tigers will encounter their <em>'birth sign year' (benmingnian)</em> in
                    2022.
                    Wearing red will bring good luck in a birth sign year. Many Chinese kids wear hats or shoes with a
                    tiger
                    image of for good luck.</p>

                <h2>Strengths of Tigers</h2>
                <p>Tigers are courageous and authoritative, although they have a cute and charming side as well to those
                    who
                    know them more intimately. Their ambitions run sky-high, however, and Tigers will never treat them
                    as
                    pipe
                    dreams.
                    They are adventurers with the courage to be a pioneer in the line of work they choose. They work
                    tirelessly
                    to
                    realize their dream of changing the world in some way, one step at a time.
                </p>
                <p>Tigers never mince their words, but always speak forthrightly and boldly. <ins> They are honest and
                        judicious,
                        almost chivalrous in a way that does not seem to fit the modern world. </ins>This quality makes
                    them
                    natural
                    leaders that
                    others gravitate toward. They have a strong sense of responsibility and will always keep their word
                    and
                    uphold
                    their obligations.</p>
                <h2>Weaknesses of Tigers</h2>
                <p>Tigers can be very rebellious, often too self-confident to want to coordinate or communicate with
                    others.
                    That frequently leaves them lonely. They may find themselves isolated at work or in the community.
                    They
                    can
                    be
                    dictators with potential love interests and unable to create a happy family life. Likewise,
                    <ins>they may
                        have a
                        lot of
                        acquaintances or professional contacts, but may not have any real friends.</ins> No one likes to
                    always be
                    alone.
                    That is a fact that the proud Tiger has to learn to accept in themselves.
                </p>
                <p>In pursuit of their goals and ambition, Tigers can be stubborn and brash, possibly willing to use
                    whatever
                    means to achieve their goals. This can appear too domineering for othersâ€™ tastes because, with such
                    single-minded
                    focus on their pursuit, Tigers may very well disregard others' feelings.
